    <p>
      Last updated: February 12, 2019
    </p>
    <p>
      IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 21. PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS<br/>
      Convergent (“Convergent”) is a blockchain-based fundraising toolkit for creators, artists, and freelancers ("Users") to interact and trade services with each other in a peer-to-peer manner. "Services" means any service a Site participant requests or performs. Site participants may consist of (a) Those who create profiles on Convergent or make Contributions (as defined below) to Creators (individually an "Economy,” collectively the Creators); (b) those who fulfill Services (individually a "Creator" or collectively the Creators); (c) those who interact with the Convergent site but do not post or fulfill Services (a “Visitor”); (d) those who buy Personal Tokens or other UGC (as defined below) (individually a “Buyer,” collectively the “Buyers”); (e) and those who create or sell Personal Tokens or other UGC (individually a “Seller,” collectively the “Sellers” and, together with Contributors, Creators, Visitors and Buyers, “Users”). The Convergent website (https://convergent.cx/, the “Site”) serves as a registration portal, product offering, and an overview of the Convergent platform. The site also includes text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information. The Site allows Contributors to fund Creators through purchase of tokens from a smart contract, allows Creators to create Economies for Contributors and allows Buyers and Sellers to buy and sell. The Site and any other features, tools, materials, or services offered from time to time by Convergent, is referred to here as the “Service.” Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or clicking to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, you (x) accept and agree to these Terms, (y) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Policy and (z) any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation issued by Convergent from time to time. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. MODIFICATIONS OF TERMS OF USE<br/>
      Except for Section 23, providing for binding arbitration and waiver of class action rights, Convergent reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time. The most current version of these Terms will be posted on our Site. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by you after any modification to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. ELIGIBILITY<br/>
      You represent and warrant that you: (a) are of legal age to form a binding contract; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from using our Services; and (c) have full power and authority to enter into this agreement and in doing so will not violate any other agreement to which you are a party. If you are registering to use the Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that (x) such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and (y) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. ROLE OF CONVERGENT<br/>
      You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the Site is merely a platform through which Conttributors, Creators, Buyers and Sellers conduct transactions. Convergent is not involved in the transactions, and has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of Services or consideration for Services, the ability of Creators to perform Services to Contributors’ satisfaction, or the ability of Creators to fulfill the Services. You are not an employee of Convergent, and Convergent does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control Creators or Services performed for or delivered to Contributors (“Creator Services”). Convergent will not have any liability or obligations under or related to Service Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions by you or other Users. Convergent has no control over Creators or the Creator Services offered or rendered by Contributors and Convergent makes no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Creator or the quality, security, or legality of any Creator Services, and Convergent disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Convergent has no control over Buyers and Sellers and Convergent makes no representations as to the quality or legality of any UGC created or sold by Sellers, and Convergent disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because convergent is not a party to the transactions between Creators and Contributors or between Buyers and Sellers, Convergent is not responsible for (i) resolving any disputes between participants related to any Services or (ii) any tax liabilities that may arise in a transaction between participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. CONVERGENT CREATORS<br/>
      As a Creator, you agree that: (a) you will interact with Contributors in a professional and courteous manner, and accurately describe your Service; (b) you may only use the Site for business, commercial, or research purposes; (c) you may not have Contributors perform Services through venues other than the Site; (d) payment will be issued and remitted upon your approval of Service; (e) payment is not refundable; (f) you will not reject Services requested by Contributors without good cause; and (g) you will not post a Service that violates any part of Section 12 of the Terms; (g) you will perform Services in a competent and workmanlike manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. CONVERGENT CONTRIBUTORS<br/>
      As a Contributor, you agree that: (a) you will interact with Creators in a professional and courteous manner, and provide reasonably requested information in connection with your performance of Services; (b) you will request Services in a competent and workmanlike manner; (c) you will supply complete, accurate, non-malicious information for all Services you request; (d) you will not perform Services through venues other than the Site; (e) you will not submit anything to Creator that violates Section 12 of the Terms; and (f) Creators may reject Services you request for good cause and currently there is no way for a Contributor to dispute any rejection of a submission made through the Site, meaning you may not be paid if a Creator rejects your submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS<br/>
      Creators perform Services for Contributors in their personal capacity as an independent contractor and not as an employee of a Contributor or Convergent. As a Creator, you agree that: (a) you are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations; (b) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Contributor, or you and Convergent; (iii) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of a Contributor or Convergent; (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that a Contributor or Convergent may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover worker's compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent contractor, Creator is free at all times to provide Creator Services to persons or businesses other than Contributor, including any competitor of Contributor. Creator does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of Contributor or Convergent. As a Contributor, you will not engage a Creator in any way that may jeopardize that Creator's status as an independent contractor performing Services for you. Creators may not require an exclusive relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. CONVERGENT CONTRACTS<br/>
      As used herein, a “Service Contract” means, as applicable, the unilateral contractual provisions created by Contributor that govern the Creator Services to be performed by Creator for Contributor for a particular Service posted to the Site and which will typically include a description of the Service or Services to be completed, the amount and type of currency as compensation, and the deadline. You acknowledge and agree that Convergent is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service Contract between any Contributor and Creators will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Convergent and Contributor or Convergent and Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. PAYMENT<br/>
      In order to use Site Services, each User must provide its Ethereum wallet address. The Site and the Site Services operate with Ether or ERC20 compatible tokens. Payment to Creators will occur upon Creator's acceptance of Contributor's Service Request. Acceptance of a Contributor's Service Request is at the sole discretion of the Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. UNAUTHORIZED USE OR ACCESS<br/>
      Unless otherwise expressly authorized in these Terms of Use or on the Site, you may not take any action to interfere with the Site or any other user’s use of the Site or decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any content or other products or processes accessible through the Site, nor insert any code or product or manipulate the content in any way that affects any User’s experience. While using the Site you are required to comply with all applicable statutes, orders, regulations, rules, and other laws. In addition, we expect users of the Website to respect the rights and dignity of others. Your use of the Site is conditioned on your compliance with the rules of conduct set forth in this Section.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN USING THE SERVICE YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO UGC FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT UGC MAY BE INACCURATE, OFFENSIVE, INDECENT OR OBJECTIONABLE. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE, AND DO HEREBY WAIVE, ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RIGHTS OR REMEDIES YOU HAVE OR MAY HAVE AGAINST US WITH RESPECT TO UGC. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH UGC. IF NOTIFIED BY A USER OR CONTENT OWNER THAT UGC ALLEGEDLY DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE LICENSE TERMS, WE MAY INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATION AND DETERMINE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION WHETHER TO REMOVE THE UGC, WHICH WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE. FOR CLARITY, WE DO NOT PERMIT COPYRIGHT-INFRINGING ACTIVITIES ON THE SERVICE.
